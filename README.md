## 5. Summary of Finding
### 5.1 Business Insight
1. Customer Response and Demographic Insights
- UnderGraduate customers and customers in a relationship with children/teenagers tend to be less responsive to campaigns.
- Low-income customers have distinct purchasing behaviors, often focusing on daily necessities.
